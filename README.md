## Potential? Ideas
| Idea | Complete? |
| :---- | :----: |
| Add download support for your own files | ✅ |
| Create android version | ❌ |
| Add to context menu (traditiional and Windows 11 (maybe idk how that works yet) for easy uploading | ❌ |
| Complete control over files, deletion, moving, sharing, etc. | ✅ |
| Debug and token management in its own tab | ✅ |
